After completing a coding bootcamp at [Northcoders](https://northcoders.com/), I'm looking forward to using the time I have before finding a job, or in fact some of my free-time once I have found one, to pursue some learning projects. The freedom to choose a learning path independently of any kind of syllabus feels both exciting and sometimes a bit overwhelming. I would like to learn a new language, but on what basis should I choose?

Presumably many other developers reach this point, having learnt Javascript or some other first language, knowing enough about programming to have an idea of the limitations of that language, but not enough to make a truly informed decision about any particular alternative.

## C#
The solution seems to be to pick one and try it out. I decided to use C# to work on the coding challenges in the [Algorithmic Toolbox](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithmic-toolbox) course. This was the first time I had worked with a statically typed language, and I intially ran into some problems working with unfamilar data-types. Beyond that, however, it was nice to find that the basics of the language already felt familiar enough. The words `public static void` finally gained some significance for me.

It's great to get some exposure to C# in this way but I doubt the advantages of a more rigourously structured language will become apparent in the context of small algorithmic code challenges. I will probably try and build some kind of text-based game using classes.
